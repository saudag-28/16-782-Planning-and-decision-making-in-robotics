# ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTED
For this symbolic planner, to speed up the process of exploring states, I have precomputed all the GroundedActions (along with their preconditions and effects). \
Initially, I generate all the combinations and permutations of the Symbols. I then iterate through each Action and each combination of the Symbols. I then map (container used: unordered_map) every argument of the Action and Condition with the Symbols and then save all the above information in a GroundedAction object. I save each of these objects in a vector (which is a vector of all GroundedActions). \
During A* search, the algorithm will iterate through this vector of GroundedActions and check if itâ€™s a valid action or not.

## HEURISTIC FUNCTION
I have implemented the following heuristic function - \
**(Number of Goal State literals not present in the current state) / (max number of literals added by an action)** \
This heuristic is admissible and it guarantees optimality.
